# hugo_layoutsghsvs

A collection of more or less dilettantish layouts, templates and more for my Hugo-based sites.

To be mounted in other Hugo-based repositories. I only mount locally. No online mounts tested.

Will be changed regularly according to my needs. Don't rely on backwards compatibility!

I take absolutely no account of build speed and/or security, as I only work with it locally.

If it works, it works. Optimisations follow step by step when I feel like it and have the time.
